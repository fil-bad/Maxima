Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) (we'll use this to find if two polygons intersect):

For partitioning space:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree

So, we start with the largest partition; each time we find an intersection, we use the QuadTree approach
in order to reduce the size of the partition. On the reduced one, we apply recursively this method (until
the size of the cell is equal or below that of the robot).
